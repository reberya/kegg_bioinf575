    "#### Question 1.\n",

    "early on in the course. I worked on the first chunk of the project \n",
    "and this was right after we learned about dataframes and their \n",
    "functions. I had a lot of trouble merging appropriately and this \n",
    "took me the most time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "dataframes, and merge them. Additionally, I learned about \n",
    "computing pertinent summaries, heading files, and ensuring my \n",
    "data was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 3.\n",
    "I would like to take expression data from different cancer types \n",

    "#### Question 1.\n",
    "My biggest challenge was going through my colleagues' code to figure out what they had done before me, and how I could use the data structures they had created to perform the step I was assigned. Not being well-versed in Pandas dataframes myself, parsing through specific lines of code would raise questions if I didn't run the code myself and inspect its elements. </br><br>\n",
    "I also realized that using the `os` library might have also made things go more smoothly when handing off parts of the code to colleagues; I made a string `path` that could be modified according to who was running the code and in what directory they wanted to put the results, because I kept having to change that manually for the code to run on my machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2.\n",
    "I learned a lot about the possibilities of using Pandas as well as different coding styles and strategies I could adapt to improve my own coding practice. Moreover, I learned the value of every team member using GitHub to have a central space to store all the files created throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 3.\n",
    "KEGG has many extensive databases and probably has more information on each pathway and gene we used in this project. It would be interesting to see what role the top 3 genes in our project play in the pathways they are a part of. Furthermore, when modeling certain pathways to study drug responses like Dr. Stacey Finley presented during one of the DCMB seminars, it would be interesting to see if including certain genes/proteins in the model would be redundant since they appear in the exact same number of pathways.\n",

    "#### Question 1\n",
    "For me, I was working on tasks 3 and 4 and the biggest challenge that I faced while working on them was merging the two dataframe in python. I was using the merge function for combining information from two dataframes and instead of converging on a unique column the code was exhaustively generating combinations and making billions of rows instead of million combinations. After debugging for a couple of hours I decided to draw what I was trying to do on a piece of paper and see if that is what the code was also doing. Once I conceptually saw the way merge command was working I realized that I needed to first make the data unique and then combine data on unique gene ids. When I updated the code according to my new understanding of the dataframe, everything worked as it was supposed to!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 2\n",
    "I learned three main things, the (1) first was how to work with multiple people and collaborate and rely on one another for completing the project, and transfer code the (2) second thing was regarding how to merge dataframes, and work with the merge function. The (3) third thing I learned was how to add in checks for the results to make sure its correct, for example, we needed to place some additional checks such; removes lines where pathway_ID1 == pathway_ID2 and pathway_ID2 == pathway_ID1 so this will give you the same rank/gene so we removed this duplication and pathway_ID1 == pathway_ID2. This taught me that sanity checks are very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 3\n",
    "I think it would have been interesting to also link the genes together to understand if the common genes were also connected to each other and we could also have constructed a gene regulatory network (GRN) which can show us the level of that association. Additionally, We could also have incorporated gene expression data from different tissues which would have made clustering easier based on common genes. We could have then generated plots such as PCA or t-SNE and we would have been able to see some good cluster formation based on common genes in different tissues. \n",

    "\n",
    "##### Question 1\n",
    "The challenge was to figure out why I could see the intersection between only 2 sets but mentioning that the function is plotting the venn diagram between the 3 sets.The venn diagram gave the labels for all the 3 genes (Gene 1, Gene 2, Gene 3), but I could see the venn diagram as it would have been had there been only 2 sets. I could see only one intersection. This issue was solved when I used the intersection function on the sets and came to know that 2 of the 3 sets were identical and had the same pathways(elements) in  them. The sets (Gene_2 and Gene3) being identical is the reason that the venn diagram came out to be the one as is in the python notebook. Furthermore, the identical sets were overlapped and then intersected with the remaining set.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 2\n",
    "When I was stuck on the interpretation of the output, I learnt that one should use the basic fucnctions too when using the advanced ones. Furthermore, when plotting a dataset, one should check its conditions separately to understand what the ouput will be. Checking the plotting conditions separately will help in easy interpretation of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 3\n",
    "If I had more time on the project, I would have found out the names of the pathways that were common in the top 3 genes and would have extracted the description of the pathway and its KEGG pathway id and entry number so that one can look out for more information for a particular pathway. \n",
